# Project ENHANCE Dashboard (Public Version)

This prototype data dashboard was created for Project ENHANCE as part of a master thesis at the TU Delft.
It has been made public for inspiration purposes only and will not be further developed. 

## Prerequisites

This dashboard is hosted via Heroku and can be visted at: https://enhance-tryout-app.herokuapp.com/ ```python
The app requires various dash packages (see requirements), numpy, pandas and plotly to be properly installed. 
Note that the app.py file was originally created in jupyter notebooks and thus uses the jupyter-dash package.
